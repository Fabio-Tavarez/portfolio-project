# Portfolio Project

For my project I decided to try and recreate a Pokedex App.

On page load it will load up the all known pokemon.

## Bugs

- On page load it loads the pokedex out of order
- Form event is not working properly

## Upcoming Features

- On click of a Pokemon loads another page where more detailed information is shown.
- Filter type functionality added where one may fiter pokemon shown by type.
